1. Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.

SQL is the language to get data

<!-- relational database is the organizing principle for the data itself -->


2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?

<!-- primary key is the reference id for data and allows for easy retrieval and change of specific data without changing other parts of the data table  -->

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

<!-- reference id -->


4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables. 

 <!-- join table  -->
